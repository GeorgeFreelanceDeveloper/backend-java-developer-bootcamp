## What is Backend Development?

Backend web development is the part of web development that deals with the server-side of a web application. This includes creating and managing the server-side logic, connecting the application to a database, creating server-side APIs, handling user authentication and authorization, and processing and responding to user requests. It often involves the use of backend development languages such as Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), and .NET languages.

## What does a Backend Developer do?

A backend developer focuses on creating and maintaining the server-side components of web applications. They are primarily tasked with developing server-side APIs, handling database operations, and ensuring that the backend can manage high traffic volumes efficiently. Key responsibilities include integrating external services such as payment gateways and cloud services, and enhancing the performance and scalability of systems. This role is crucial for processing and securing data, serving as the backbone that supports frontend developers in delivering a seamless user experience.

## How to become Backend Developer?
If you are a complete beginner who is just getting started, you can start by learning a backend programming language such as Python, Ruby, Java, Go etc. Once you have got the basic to intermediate understanding of the language, learn about the package manager for that language and learn how to install and use external packages into your applications. Learn the basics of some relational database e.g. PostgreSQL and learn how to run simple CRUD operations. Optionally, you can pick up and learn a web framework for the language of your choice as well. Learn how to build a simple RESTful API and implement simple Authentication/Authorization into it. While you are learning all the items mentioned above, don't forget to learn about Git and GitHub as well.

After following all the instructions above, you can start applying for the entry level backend developer jobs. Also, look at the backend developer roadmap above to get an idea about the landscape and see what else you are missing. A degree in computer science or related field is not always necessary but networking, building a portfolio and actively seeking internships, junior developer positions or consulting can help to start and advance a career as a backend developer.

Note: remember to make a lot of projects while you are learning to solidify your understanding of the concepts. Also, it's important to have the attitude of continuous learning to improve your skills and be prepared for the fast-paced technology evolution in the industry.
