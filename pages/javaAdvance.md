## Collection framwork
Java Collection Framework is unlikely any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit be it of any type is known as the collection of objects. Earlier in Java, there was no such thing defined which holds true for it so there arises a need in the next versions of any such concept. So in JDK 1.2, a separate framework was defined known as “Collection Framework” which holds all the collection classes and interfaces in it. 

The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

## Functional programming
So far Java was supporting the imperative style of programming and object-oriented style of programming. The next big thing what java has been added is that Java has started supporting the functional style of programming with its Java 8 release. In this article, we will discuss functional programming in Java 8. 

**What is functional programming?**

It is a declarative style of programming rather than imperative. The basic objective of this style of programming is to make code more concise, less complex, more predictable, and easier to test compared to the legacy style of coding. Functional programming deals with certain key concepts such as pure function, immutable state, assignment-less programming etc.

## Streams
Java 8 introduces Stream, which is a new abstract layer, and some new additional packages in Java 8 called java.util.stream. A Stream is a sequence of components that can be processed sequentially. These packages include classes, interfaces, and enum to allow functional-style operations on the elements.

The stream can be used by importing java.util.stream package. Stream API is used to process collections of objects. Streams are designed to be efficient and can support improving your program’s performance by allowing you to avoid unnecessary loops and iterations. Streams can be used for filtering, collecting, printing, and converting from one data structure to another, etc.
